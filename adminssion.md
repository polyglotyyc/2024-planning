# Admission

## Fee or Free

A high fee will deter a lot of people from coming, especially in the current economy.

A small fee (vs free), say 20 CAD, should eliminate or severely reduce people registering with low intention of showing up. It will will reduce the number of people coming for the wrong reasons which should increase sponsors interest (if we do go ahead with sponsorships).
