# Website

- information for sponsors to contact us
- QR code for exit survey
- social network ish where people can upload photos

### Website Ideas

- Share Event Links
- Share a Post on [platform_name] and get a some discount on ticket price (perhaps tickets are 25$ and posting on social media/sharing the event gives them 5$ off. Kind of a growth hacking/discount approach)?
- Create new EventBrite page or find an alternative to sell tickets (EventCreate is another service) and capture attendee data.

### Social Media

With Social media accounts on _X_, _Instagram_, and _Facebook (optional depending on Instagram business accounts)_, We can help generate buzz and awareness.

I think we will need a good plan or post topics. Some topics I was thinking of:

- Announcing Sponsors when they decide to help us, talk a bit about their tech and business adventure in the post. Add a link to the story and post so businesses can find out more information on how to sponsor (link to a page/section in our site). Add a link for business/tech users to buy tickets or get more information on the event
- Number of Attendees posts
- Speaker updates: who they are, their speech topic, time, etc.
